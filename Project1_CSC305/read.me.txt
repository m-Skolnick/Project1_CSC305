Summary:
In the main function, a while loop receives instructions until the code "q" is entered
 to stop the program. 
All data is stored in a single txt file
When data is added, the txt file is opened, data is written, then the text file is closed.
When data is retrieved, the txt file is opened, data retrieved, the txt file is closed.
Data about each team such as wins, losses, PF, PA, winning percentage, etc...
are stored in a structure named "team"
For easier sorting/retrieval of data, a temporary array of team structures is created each time
data is retrieved from the txt file.
When the user asks for data, the array of structures is built, then the desired data
is retrieved -> printed for the user.
